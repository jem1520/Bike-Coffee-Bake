  SEO or Search Engine Optimization is how search engines such as google rank a website. Good
SEO is key to a website receiving a good ranking relative to other sites and how it will appear
in search. Header tags are import and H1 is the most important, it's not good practice to use more than one H1 tag per page. Adding ghost content is also not a good way to boost SEO, instead focus on making the content as relevant and optimized as possible. Add links to other "high quality" sites and let them link back, this is a great way to improve SEO. Linking to lower quality sites can lower SEO. Add social media links and share buttons, so that it is simple to share the website on other accounts. Using SEO correctly helps to provide organic traffic, which is often better than paid traffic through adds.

  Finally use tools like Google Analytics to learn about user traffic and where users are moving
and looking on pages. Then use the analytics information to make site improvements. As an example moving important content to places on the screen that receive the most user time would be helpful. Use analytics to track clicks or time spend on pages and use this information to improve overall site user experience and SEO.





To implement SEO double check that there is only one H1 tag per page and that each page has an H1
tag. Check through the rest of header tags and make sure that content is relevant.
Assure that site doesn't have ghost pages or text. Make sure that as many relevant
links to social media and other sites are setup and flow with page content. Create social tags and share buttons for all social medias. Use KPI to determine if site is performing
as expected. Also use Google Analytics to determine user patterns and implement site
updates and improvements based on analysis.
